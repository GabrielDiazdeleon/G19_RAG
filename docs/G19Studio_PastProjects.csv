HIV Data Enclave and Getting to Zero Dashboard,"The comprehensive infrastructure for public health surveillance of HIV in Chicago aims to enhance coordination within health department HIV programs, improve continuity of care, and expand prevention and care services for individuals at risk or living with HIV. It facilitates secure, de-identified data sharing with clinical providers and community organizations to enable timely HIV service delivery. This infrastructure collects, analyzes, interprets, and disseminates HIV data, supporting data-driven planning, monitoring, and evaluation of HIV interventions. Automated data feeds from public health and external sources streamline reporting, bi-directional data sharing for rapid HIV care identification, and generation of provider-specific reports. Hosted on HIPAA-compliant Amazon Web Services infrastructure, the HIV Data Enclave uses Datavant for privacy-preserving data linkage and features automated data pipelines for extraction, harmonization, and storage. This system supports combined HIV surveillance and program data management, exemplified by its role in reducing follow-up times for patients lacking evidence of care, enhancing reporting efficiency, and triggering targeted interventions through predictive analytics.

Getting to Zero Illinois is a statewide initiative to end the HIV epidemic by 2030. The GTZ-IL initiative is accompanied by a plan that outlines the goals and strategies which promote HIV prevention and access to care. The data dashboard helps users track progress towards the goals and strategies found in this plan",,2019,2022,Center of Disease Control via Chicago Department of Public Health,"Northwestern, University of Chicago, Howard Brown Health, Aids Foundation Chicago",PS18-1802: Integrated HIV Prevention Programs for Health Departments Component B,"Tableau, AWS, SQL",https://dashboard.gtzillinois.hiv/
BESTMED: Observational Evaluation of Second-Line Therapy Medications in Diabetes,"The study aims to enhance the quality of evidence available for the treatment decisions of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) patients and their clinicians. By utilizing a nationwide database of real-world data, the project employs advanced statistical methods to emulate a randomized clinical trial, offering comparative insights into various T2DM medications. Emphasizing outcomes crucial to patients, such as clinical events and significant adverse reactions, the study seeks to provide actionable insights that align closely with real-world treatment scenarios. With participation from a coalition of health plans and integrated healthcare systems serving over 130 million patients nationally, initial data collection efforts have already amassed substantial information from sites like Humana, MGB, University of Iowa, and University of Missouri, encompassing approximately 2.2 million patients, 300 million encounters, 140 million lab counts, and 84 million procedure counts.

ILPQC Data Consortium,"The ILPQC (Illinois Perinatal Quality Collaborative) initiatives and data system focus on improving perinatal care across Illinois through collaborative efforts among healthcare providers. The initiatives aim to enhance the quality of care for mothers and infants by implementing evidence-based practices and protocols. The data system serves as a comprehensive platform for collecting and analyzing perinatal health data from participating hospitals and healthcare facilities statewide. It enables the ILPQC to monitor outcomes, identify trends, and implement targeted interventions to improve maternal and infant health outcomes. Through this collaborative approach and robust data system, ILPQC strives to achieve significant advancements in perinatal care quality and patient outcomes across Illinois.",,2014,Present,Illinois Perinatal Quality Collaborative,,,"Zoho Analytics, SQL, RedCap",https://ilpqc.org/
COVID Dashboard,"A web-based dashboard that offers real-time or regularly updated information related to COVID-19. This includes data such as infection rates, hospitalizations, testing statistics, vaccination coverage, and other relevant metrics specific to the COVID-19 pandemic. The dashboard serves as a public resource for residents, healthcare professionals, policymakers, and researchers to access current data trends and make informed decisions related to managing and responding to the COVID-19 situation in the area served by the Cook County Department of Public Health (CCDPH).",,Feb-23,May-23,Cook County Health,Iyka,,"Rshiny, SQL",https://ccdphcd.shinyapps.io/covid19/
EHE and Literature Dashboard,"The EHE Project Dashboard and the Literature Review Dashboard are interactive tools designed to support HIV implementation science and inform HIV prevention and care interventions. The EHE Project Dashboard features NIH-funded supplement projects aimed at enhancing the implementation science base for the Ending the HIV Epidemic Initiative. It provides data on characteristics and findings of over 200 US-based projects, categorized by EHE pillars, settings, geographic regions, priority populations, types of interventions, and Implementation Science Frameworks. Similarly, the Literature Review Dashboard compiles 239 peer-reviewed US studies focused on determinants of PrEP implementation, offering insights into settings, geographic regions, priority populations, and implementation domains. Both dashboards are updated periodically to provide researchers and practitioners with valuable information to inform program design, grant writing, and gaps in HIV implementation research.",,Jun-23,Sep-23,HIV Implementation Science Coordination Iniative,,,Power BI,"website: https://hivimpsci.northwestern.edu/

Research Portal and Dahboard,"We developed an automated registry for the American College of Surgeons (ACS) featuring a multi-utility survey platform integrated with the REDCap system. This secure web-based data management portal enables direct data collection from patients and providers, manages user access, creates patient profiles, tracks data collection timelines, sends alerts and reminders, prepares reports, and implements necessary checks. One study using this platform evaluated the impact of non-opioid education on surgical patients, with a customized report for tracking and scaling the initiative. The portal followed guidelines for conducting surveys and collecting longitudinal data, featuring calendaring functions, automated survey triggers, and alerts for providers to ensure complete data collection.

Data safety and security were paramount, with IRB approvals managed through the portal and secure access isolated by site. Patient data was de-identified before report generation, and robust measures were in place to protect data and prevent re-identification. Quality assurance included data validation, user training, and detailed guidelines to prevent errors. The system underwent rigorous testing and validation with both informatics and administrative teams before going live. Consistent data collection was ensured through predefined survey tools, with a maintained data dictionary for long-term consistency. The informatics team was responsible for building and validating the data dictionary to support the portal's development and functionality.",,,,American College of Surgeons,,,,
HepCATT,"The Hepatitis C Community Alliance to Test and Treat (HepCATT) in Chicago aimed to harness the strengths of its partners to enhance the continuum of care for hepatitis C-infected individuals by building a sustainable and robust infrastructure.
